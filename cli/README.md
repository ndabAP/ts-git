# ts-git CLI

This is the source for the `ts-git` CLI wrapper.

## Installation

`npm install -g @nathanfriend/ts-git-cli`

## Usage

The goal of `ts-git-cli` is to align as closely as possible with the real [git](https://git-scm.com/) interface. Since `ts-git` is just a learning tool, only a subset of git's features are implemented. To view which commands are available, run:

`ts-git --help`
